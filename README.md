# My Very First Webpage

Welcome!

This is a webpage to get myself used to the different steps needed to help me launch my projects.

This project includes html coding along with CSS to style out the pages and the fundamental technologies and processes to store the data into repositories in order to make changes and track them. This is done via Git and stored in GitHub.
